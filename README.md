## Introduction

Blitz is a **desktop-only** web editor for designing and refining autonomous robot trajectories. Built to reduce friction on complex tasks, it emphasizes **customizability**, **ease of use**, and **accessibility across skill levels**.

---

## Key Features

Blitz takes inspiration from Adobe Illustrator:
- **Tool-driven interactions** determine how elements respond to clicks and drags.
- A **canvas** as the primary area for graphical interaction.
- An **info panel** for **discrete** numeric editing.
- A **trajectories (layers) panel** for managing paths.

Together, these enable **high-precision** trajectory editing.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TypeScript  
- **Canvas:** Konva / react-konva  
- **State:** Zustand (editor store + data store)  
- **Tooling:** ESLint, Prettier (optional)  
- **Paradigm:** Partial OOP *(Java influence)*

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** ≥ 18 (recommended)

### Install
```sh
# pick one
pnpm install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Run (Local)
```sh
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open the printed local URL (commonly http://localhost:5173).

### Build
```sh
pnpm build
# or npm run build / yarn build
```

## Tools — Current Semantics

- **Select:** Click a control point to select it (and its trajectory). Drag to move if unlocked. Click a path to select its trajectory.
- **Add:** With a trajectory selected, click the canvas to add a control point at that world position; the new point becomes active.
- **Remove:** Click a control point to delete it; the parent trajectory becomes selected.
- **Insert:** Click on a trajectory path to insert a control point projected onto the nearest segment at the clicked position.
- **Cut:** Click a control point to split its trajectory into two; the trajectories panel will display both halves.
